The present study was designed to determine the effect of the IGA in the application of EWCT, and the results have shown that the IGA has a good tomographic inversion imaging quality. The proposed algorithm of IGA improves the diversity of the population through cloning, crossover and mutation operations. At the same time, it can control the evolution direction of the population by adjusting the concentration of each individual, which effectively reduced the local optimal solution problems encountered in the SGA algorithm. Besides, the global search ability of the objective function is guaranteed by the memory unit. Therefore, this paper provides a guarantee for the safety and efficient production of coal mines, and also provides a new strategy for inversion problems in other fields.
